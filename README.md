# BookAppWithKMP

BookAppWithKMP is a Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) application designed to allow users to search for books and manage a list of their favorite books. It demonstrates the use of modern Android development practices and KMP for shared business logic across platforms (Android and iOS).

## Features

*   **Book Search:** Search for books using an external API (e.g., Google Books API - *specify if you know which one*).
*   **Favorite Books:** Users can mark books as favorites.
*   **Offline Storage:** Favorite books are stored locally on the device.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Shared business logic for Android and iOS.
*   **Modern UI:** Built with Jetpack Compose for Android and potentially SwiftUI or Compose Multiplatform for iOS.

## Architecture

This project follows a Clean Architecture approach (or similar, like MVVM/MVI if applicable) with a focus on separating concerns:

*   **Presentation Layer:** (Jetpack Compose UI) Handles UI display and user interaction. It uses ViewModels to interact with the domain layer.
*   **Domain Layer:** Contains the core business logic, use cases, and domain models. This layer is platform-agnostic.
*   **Data Layer:** Responsible for providing data to the domain layer, either from a remote API or a local database. It includes repositories and data sources.

*(Elaborate more here if you have a specific architectural pattern you've strictly followed, e.g., MVI with specific state management patterns).*

## Technologies Used

*   **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP):** For sharing code between Android and iOS.
*   **Jetpack Compose:** For building the Android UI.
*   **Compose Multiplatform:** (Implicitly, if you're targeting iOS UI from the shared module).
*   **Coroutines:** For asynchronous programming.
*   **Koin:** For dependency injection.
*   **Ktor:** For networking (fetching book data from an API).
*   **Room:** For local database storage (e.g., storing favorite books).
*   **Coil 3:** For image loading.
*   **Jetpack Navigation (Compose):** For navigating between screens.
*   **Gradle Kotlin DSL:** For build configuration.
*   **Material Design 3:** For UI components and styling.
*   **Kotlinx Serialization:** For JSON parsing.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main modules:

*   `composeApp`: The main shared module containing common logic, UI (if using Compose Multiplatform for iOS), domain, and data layers.
    *   `commonMain`: Code shared across all platforms (Android, iOS, etc.).
        *   `book/`: Feature module for book-related functionalities.
            *   `data/`: Data sources, repositories, DTOs.
            *   `domain/`: Use cases, entities.
            *   `presentation/`: ViewModels, UI state, Compose screens (if shared).
        *   `core/`: Core utilities, base classes, DI setup.
    *   `androidMain`: Android-specific implementations, Android App entry point.
    *   `iosMain`: iOS-specific implementations, iOS App entry point.
*   `buildSrc` or `gradle/libs.versions.toml`: For managing dependencies and versions.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Android Studio (latest stable version recommended, e.g., Iguana or Hedgehog)
*   Kotlin Plugin
*   JDK 11 or higher
*   (For iOS) Xcode (latest stable version)
*   (For iOS) cocoapods (if used for iOS dependencies)

### Building and Running

**Android:**

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/masudrana35362/KMP-Book-Apps`
2.  Open the project in Android Studio.
3.  Let Gradle sync the project.
4.  Select the `composeApp` run configuration.
5.  Choose an emulator or connect a physical Android device.
6.  Click the "Run" button.

**iOS:**

1.  Navigate to the `iosApp` directory (or the relevant directory for your iOS project).
2.  *(If using Cocoapods)*: Run `pod install` or `pod update`.
3.  Open the `.xcworkspace` (or `.xcodeproj`) file in Xcode.
4.  Select an iOS simulator or connect a physical iOS device.
5.  Click the "Run" button in Xcode.

*(Add any specific build commands or configurations if necessary, e.g., if API keys are needed).*
